# Final-Web-App
After going through many different solutions, i decided to restart the entire application and the database was still not running on my docker. So I created a new repository and after a little fiddling, I came up with a solution and fixed it by reinstalling pycharm and docker. But only the cities database is working on it. So I had to do all of it on this database. The Postman app just stopped working on my computer as well. If you go through my code, it should look good. I didn't see anything wrong with the code. It has to be something wrong with my computer. My laptop broke midway through this semester and I've been using an old computer ever since.
