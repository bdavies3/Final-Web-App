# Final-Web-App
After going through many different solutions, i decided to restart the entire application and the database was still not running on my docker. But after a little fiddling, I came up with a solution and fixed it by reinstalling pycharm and docker. But only the cities database is working on it. So I had to do all of it on this database.
